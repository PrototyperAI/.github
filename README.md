# Hello World!

Prototyper is an applied LLM research lab and product company working on reinventing software design. Our approach is to build tools that let you create exactly what you are thinking, nothing more. Software that feels personal, intentional, and crafted with care. 

We believe that great software should feel like an extension of your mind. It should work the way you think, adapt to your needs, and eliminate unnecessary complexity. Using a combination of AI and thoughtful design, we're making software that's both powerful and effortlessly simple.

We are a group of designers and engineers obsessed with quality. We build tools that help people create software they're proud ofâ€”software that's focused, meaningful, and built to last. Our work has already helped thousands of users build better products.

## Our principles

1. Quality
2. Focus on humans
3. Creativity
